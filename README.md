# Ascension Island Detainment (AID)

![Ascension Island Detainment](AID.png) This is an idea for detainment or containment of criminals that commit murder and unprovoked aggravated assault. The author views other crimes as lesser offenses and not part of the scope of this project.

Ascension Island Detainment sorts these criminals into two groups that are detained by dropping them off on separate islands, an island for each type of criminal.

The islanders are provided cyclically minimal basic supplies that they need to survive such as food, water, clothing, and shelter as needed. Potentially other supplies could be provided via donations and requests by the islanders. Electricity would not be provided to the island, but would not be hindered, and could potentially be developed on the island.

The detainment security is composed of patrol boats and a multitude of flying camera drones. Armed security staff would circle the island in the patrol boats, ensuring that the islanders do not escape the island. The camera drones would be managed and maintained by another ship or location that controls the movements of the drones ensuring that their feeds connect to the internet or a satellite-provided television network at all times.

An island is continually recorded and streamed on live broadcasts via one or both of the previously mentioned networks. The purpose of this is two-fold:

(1) The stream serves island security.

(2) The stream also serves to raise awareness of humanity's ascension into 5D consciousness.

The islanders are bound by the Law of the Uninitiated and freed by the Law of Ascension. The Law of Ascension is defined as how consciousness of self is continually evolving, rising, or expanding into greater states of awareness. Consciousness is multidimensional. Ascension Island Detainment recognizes that intelligent life has the potential to become fifth dimensional in consciousness. At this level of consciousness, an individual is known to be firmly on the path of ascension. This 5D ascension is an initiation into the greater awareness of unity and soul.

Thus ascension becomes the reform or transform, the goal of the islanders, if they wish to be released from their detainment.

Recognizing ascension in others is a judgment call that requires the services of individuals capable of fourth and preferably fifth dimensional consciousness. These individuals would form a judgment council. The role of the council would be to monitor the islanders for the purpose of nominating an islander for an interview. After the interview the council would vote on whether to approve the islander's freedom. The interview process would be a special event and streamed live, where the islander is removed from the island and delivered to sit in front of the council. The council would then internally conduct the interview using their gift's bestowed upon them by the Creator.

Islanders would also be able to have visitors stay on the island with them indefinitely. In addition, screened volunteers would also be able to come and go onto the island. All would be aware that the island is a law unto itself. Thus murder and assault would not be crimes on the island, or at least, would not prosecuted by the external authority.

Islanders would not be allowed to be gifted with electronic technology or weapons other than those that have been created on the island. The islanders would be enabled to create their own way of life and develop a culture as they see fit.

Live streaming the events on the island would create followers that would want to support or punish an islander. A follower could reward an islander by making financial donations linked to an islander's needs, such as purchasing supply donations, or for funding a personal account. This account would be sort of a trust fund that would be held until an islander was either released and given to the former islander, or assumed by AID when the islander died.

Tracking an islander would be a neccessity, so a chip implant or body tatoo could serve this purpose.

Communicating with islanders would be also neccessary. If a volunteer joined in the population of the island, then they could serve as a liason between the islanders and the authority/security.

There could potentially be multiple islands used for detainment if an island was to become over-crowded.
